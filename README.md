# Genetic-Algorithm-Neural-Network
An implementation of a neural network in my game https://github.com/AdrienHeisch/NotSpaceWar. It is trained by a genetic algorithm against the IA used in the game.

Note that the chromosomes and fitness are only displayed in the console when you open the program in the IDE at the moment, so you will only be able to see the ship getting smarter with time.
